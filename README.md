Tool for QR Code maze traversal

This tool scans images for QR codes, and displays the order in which they were encountered. 
By filling a maze with QR codes, you can take the video from a maze traversal and use this tool to determine the path taken.

Video must be broken down into a series of still frames to be analyzed.
